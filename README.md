## ✨ Project Overview

**Autopenters** is a project developed for the CyberShield Hakathon. The goal of this project is to automate various penetration testing tasks to identify and report vulnerabilities in a systematic and efficient manner. This project leverages a combination of open-source tools and custom scripts to create a comprehensive security testing framework.

The project aims to streamline the penetration testing workflow, from initial reconnaissance to final reporting, enabling security professionals to focus on critical vulnerabilities and remediation strategies.

## 🎯 Features

Based on the tools and technologies used, this project has the following capabilities:

*   **Automated Reconnaissance:** Utilizes tools like Shodan, Nmap, and OSINT platforms to gather information about target systems.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employs scanners like Nikto and OWASP ZAP to identify common web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation:** Integrates with frameworks like Metasploit for automated exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
*   **SQL Injection Testing:** Uses sqlmap to perform automated SQL injection and database takeover.
*   **Custom Scripting:** Leverages Python with libraries like `pwntools`, `impacket`, and `scapy` for custom exploit development and network interaction.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Includes scripts for privilege escalation checks on both Linux and Windows systems.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Generates comprehensive reports in PDF format using libraries like ReportLab and WeasyPrint.
