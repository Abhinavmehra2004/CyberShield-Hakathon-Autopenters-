# 🚀 AutoPent – Automated Penetration Testing Framework

## 📌 Overview

**AutoPent** is an **AI-powered penetration testing framework** designed to automate the complete security testing lifecycle.
It combines **reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, privilege escalation, AI-driven analysis, and automated reporting** into a single integrated platform.

Unlike traditional tools, AutoPent leverages **LLM (LLaMA 3.1)** to provide intelligent recommendations, generate remediation steps, and analyze vulnerabilities dynamically.

## ⚡ Key Features

* 🔍 **Automated Reconnaissance** – Domain, subdomain, and service discovery.
* 🛡 **Vulnerability Scanning** – Automated scans using Nmap, OpenVAS, and custom scripts.
* 🎯 **Exploitation Engine** – Metasploit-based automated exploitation with controlled payloads.
* 🔑 **Privilege Escalation** – Post-exploitation privilege escalation & persistence detection.
* 🤖 **AI Security Analysis** – LLaMA 3.1 for intelligent vulnerability assessment & mitigation strategies.
* 📑 **Automated Reports** – Professional, compliance-ready PDF/HTML reports.
* 🎨 **Interactive GUI** – PyQt5-based dashboard for intuitive control and monitoring.

## ✨ The AutoPent Advantage: A New Paradigm in Security

AutoPent isn't just another security tool; it is a **first-of-its-kind framework** that fundamentally redefines automated offensive security. It bridges the critical gap between static scanning and dynamic, intelligent analysis, creating a new category of security tooling.

*   **True End-to-End Integration:** While most tools focus on one phase (like scanning or reporting), AutoPent is the only framework that seamlessly integrates the entire workflow: from initial reconnaissance and multi-layered scanning to automated exploitation, privilege escalation, and AI-driven reporting.

*   **AI-Powered Decision Making:** This is what makes AutoPent truly unique. It is the first open-source framework to embed a powerful Large Language Model (**LLaMA 3.1**) at its core. It doesn't just find vulnerabilities; it *understands* them in context, prioritizes risks, and generates actionable remediation strategies that go far beyond static rule-based outputs.

*   **From Data Overload to Actionable Intelligence:** Traditional tools produce thousands of lines of output, leaving the analysis to the user. AutoPent’s AI engine processes this raw data, correlates findings from different modules, and delivers a prioritized list of credible, exploitable threats. It transforms noise into clear, actionable intelligence.

*   **A Unified Command Center:** By integrating a powerful backend with an intuitive **PyQt5 GUI**, AutoPent provides a single, unified dashboard for orchestrating complex penetration tests. This makes advanced security testing accessible without forcing users to master a dozen different command-line tools and manually manage their outputs.
